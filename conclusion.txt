1) Sim-Fast is just functional and does not give any info on architecture hence it's also the fastest
2) Sim-Cache is also mostly just functional, but it does implement the caching system and gives cache miss rates
3) Sim-OutOrder is a fully architectural sim and gives detailed simulation and is very slow
4) Changing the predictor to 2lev from Bimod and did not change prediction accuracy.
5) Changing the cache to 4 way associative reduced the cache miss rate but not as much as 8 way and reduced CPI
6) Changing the cache to 8 way associative reduced the cache miss rate and reduced CPI
7) Changing the L2 cache did not affect l2 misses in any way but significantly worsened CPI
8) Increasing memory latency slighly increased CPI
9) Warming up the pipeline gave a better representation of a full pipeline execution .
10) (warm up changed from 100M to 10M as there is only 73M Inst in Perl
